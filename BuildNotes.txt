For this build of the game, I've added all the functionality and animations for movement, attacking, and
damage to enemy characters. The animations aren't final and I would like to find better animations and
improve on the smoothness of the transitions. The models are just placeholders until a theme and proper models
are found. For future builds I would like to improve on the camera movement, and add more animations and smooth out the combat system.
This build is just to demonstrate the basic primary mechanics that the game will be centered around.

Features that need to be fixed:
- Constantly attacking sometimes doesnt register as a hit on the enemy
- Animations when landing then running will sometimes transition to idle first
- Camera will zoom in too close when sprinting/flying fast and moving left or right
